# Dynamic NFTs
This repo will support the [Creating Dynamic NFTs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E7Rm1LUKhj4) tutorial.  

## How to Use The Repo

This repo consists of two files:
- **1_starter.sol**: This is the starter file with the basic OpenZeppelin contract plus helper functions
- **2_complete.sol**: the final contract for use with keepers

Both versions of the contracts can be deployed as is via a tool like [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
